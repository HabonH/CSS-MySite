          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <p>I first found out about coding when I was a teenager and had to create my first website using HTML and CSS. I found it fascinating that you can create something by coding and make it look great! As I got older and was figuring out what career I would like to get into, I came across Web Development and as curious as I am, I looked into it. Only to realise that I've done this before and I got excited because I remembered how much I enjoyed it. Now I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer and I truly enjoy what I do!</p>

          <h3>Water Coloring</h3>
          <p>During my free time, I have gotten into water coloring. When I first started, my painting would always look like a blob of colors but when I decided that it doesn't matter how my paintings turned out, as long as I enjoyed it, I started to get better! It's a great way to destress and have some self care.</p>
